# Simple Scoreboard App

This is a simple scoreboard app that I put together to make it more visually appealing at a monthly quiz night I host at the local pub. I want to keep score and show it to the participants on the same screen that I served the quiz from. It was quite good because at the end of each round, I input the figures together, whether a joker was played during that round for that particular team, and hit a button, which then reorganizes the rows. It's very gimmicky, but the crowd seems to like it, so I'm keeping it and thought I would share!

## Install the dependencies
```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash

```


### Lint the files

# or
npm run lint
```


### Build the app for production
```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.config.js](https://v2.quasar.dev/quasar-cli-vite/quasar-config-js).
